    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        I am a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at the Indian
        Institute of Technology Kanpur, with a strong passion for software
        development and problem-solving. I enjoy building efficient, clean, and
        well-structured solutions while continuously expanding my technical
        knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Academic Background:</strong> I completed my schooling from
        Matrix High School, Sikar (Rajasthan), where I built a strong foundation
        in mathematics and logical reasoning. I am currently pursuing my
        B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of
        Technology Kanpur, where I am strengthening my knowledge of programming,
        data structures, algorithms, and computer science fundamentals.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Areas of Interest:</strong> My areas of interest include web
        development, backend systems, algorithm design, competitive programming,
        and data-driven applications. I am particularly interested in applying
        algorithms and programming concepts to solve real-world engineering
        problems.
